# Intro to Web Dev - Week 1

## Starting with HTML
After going through the [Hack Club Workshop](https://hackclub.com/workshops/personal_website), you now know how to create a static website with all the basic HTML elements. Just as a reminder, here is the basic setup of every HTML file before you get started working:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

  <title>Title Here!</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```
This is just the basic setup of a website. You have to add your own elements to it! Check out the list below for all the elements you can use!
