# Introduction to Front End Web Development
This is a tutorial offered by the LAHS Hack Club to introduce high school students to front-end web development. It will cover the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help you create your first static web page, which you can put on your personal `lahs.club` URL so you can access it from anywhere!

## Getting Started
To get started, you will have to first learn the basics of GitHub, a version control software that developers love to use. Version control (and GitHub) allows you to share your code with other people, travel back in your code's history if you made a mistake, and more.

### Downloading Git
You can download Git in several different forms.
- ‚≠ê If you prefer a desktop application with an easy-to-understand graphical interface, you can download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com).
- If you want to explore complex features of Git but still want a GUI, download the [GitKraken Git Client](https://)
- If you're comfortable using Terminal or CMD, you can download the Git CLI [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Using GitHub Desktop
If you downloaded GitHub Desktop, you should be able to open repositories from github.com in Desktop. Navigate to any repo, click the green download Code button, and click Open in Desktop. This will prompt you to clone the repository somewhere onto your device. You can then use Desktop to switch branches, make changes (called commits) and get the newest changes from GitHub.

### Using Git CLI
After downloading Git, you should be able to execute `git` commands on the command line. Try it out! See what you can do by typing `git --help` in the console. We will use it to copy the tutorial folder onto your device and manage your progress throughout the tutorial. You can download the project into a specific folder by `cd` to a desired folder and execute the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/LAHSHackClub/web-tutorial
```
After that, you can manage which week you are on by executing the following command:
```
git checkout <week>
```
For example, `git checkout week-1` gives you the first week's material.
