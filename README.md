# Introduction to Front End Web Development
This is a tutorial offered by the LAHS Hack Club to introduce high school students to front-end web development. It will cover the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help you create your first static web page, which you can put on your designated lahs.club subdomain.

## Getting Started
To get started, you will have to first learn the basics of GitHub, a version control software that developers love to use. You can download Git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

After downloading Git, you should be able to execute `git` commands on the command line. Try it out! See what you can do by typing `git --help` in the console. We will use it to copy the tutorial folder onto your device and manage your progress throughout the tutorial. You can download the project into a specific folder by `cd` to a desired folder and execute the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/LAHSHackClub/web-tutorial
```
After that, you can manage which week you are on by executing the following command:
```
git checkout <week>
```
For example, `git checkout week-1` gives you the first week's material.
