# Intro to Web Dev - Week 1

## Starting with HTML
After going through the [Hack Club Workshop](https://hackclub.com/workshops/personal_website), you now know how to create a static website with all the basic HTML elements. Just as a reminder, here is the basic setup of every HTML file before you get started working:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

  <title>Title Here!</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```
This is just the basic setup of a website. You have to add your own elements to it! Check out the list below for all the elements you can use!

## HTML Elements
| HTML Tag      | Description                                                           | Example Usage                  |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `<p>`         | Paragraph Element - You would use this for normal text.               | `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>`  |
| `<h1>`        | Header Element -  `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, etc. represent different levels of headers. | `<h1>I am a header</h1>` |
| `<a>`         | Hyperlink Element - Use special attribute `href` to specify the link to visit. | `<a href="lahs.club">This links to our main website!</a>` |
| `<div>`       | Content Division Element - Typically used for general purpose, like creating a box, or a positioned block of elements. | `<div>` |
| | | `  <h1>Header</h1>` |
| | | `  <p>This is a block of many elements!</p>` |
| | | `</div>` |
